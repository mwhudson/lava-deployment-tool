Missing features:

 - Restore
 - Migration from installation based on our PPA
 - Creating user accounts for each instance

Bugs:
 - apart from uwsgi workers everything else runs as root
 - ownership and permissions of media files are not right (media files are
   exposed to www-data user which defeats privacy)
 - network issues (pip) cause the script to fail badly, needs more checks
 - apache config is broken, we need either sensible defaults and separate
   vhosts or no vhosts and full customizability (mouting app under any root)
 - does not work very well on lucid due to upstart (missing features)

Missing features:
 - Migration from installation based on our PPA
 - Setting up rabbitmq vhost
 - Setting up SSL

Bugs:
 - upstart scripts for celery are broken
 - set -e just does not work, all error checking is broken, darn! (needs testing, got fixed)
 - does not work very well on lucid due to upstart (missing features)
 - successful backup should have option to prune old backups
